Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Julian: Presentation Slide,Script, Cleaning 
Elijah: Plotting, Data Collection, visualization
Jason: ETL

Everyone: Presentation

Target audience: Anyone interested in the reaction and response to homelessness.
Local residents that are affected by rising prices and median income in both Austin and San Francisco

Research question: what is the Cost of living between Austin and San Francisco and the comparison of homelessness and, building policies.

Results: Median Income(SF): $123,859
Results: Median Income(ATX): $75,413

Results: House to Income Ratio(SF): 12.3
Results: House to Income Ratio(ATX): 8.0

According to the building policies and the services available, San Francisco has a much more established method and procedure when it come to being homeless vs the policies that are implemented by Austin. These are more towards the line of not being favorable to the homeless individual(s) with architecture that is meant to be a deterrant for them.

The Texas Legislature has dedicated $25 million to address homelessness, mental illness and substance abuse. But many cities have also adopted their own strategies, including camping bans, large shelters and citywide databases to track people experiencing homelessness.

The San Francisco Legislation on it's own allocated 1.1 billion dollars to the Homeless effort in the fiscal year of 2021 to 2022.

Results: San Francisco has way more funding to be able to withstand the cases of homelessness.

Homeless Density Variations are more prevalent and correlate with population density.

We found that it would be based off of what the situation is for the individual and their circumstance. For someone that is going to be trying to be processed through the system and then into a home or abode, San Francisco would have the better opportunity. If the person in question is only trying to get by with out government assistance, they may fare better in Austin.

Conclusion: Conclusion: Navigating the Vague Path Forward

The homeless issue between Austin and San Francisco is a vague and intricate tapestry, woven from the threads of countless lives and experiences. It resists simplistic solutions and demands a nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to homelessness. While both cities grapple with this challenge, their journeys are distinct, reflecting the uniqueness of their urban environments and the communities they nurture.

As we navigate the shadows of homelessness in Austin and San Francisco, we must acknowledge the complexity of this issue and the vague, uncertain paths that lie ahead. The homeless issue is not a monolith but a collection of stories, struggles, and aspirations. It is only through a deeper understanding of these complexities that we can hope to create a more compassionate and inclusive society where homelessness becomes a vague memory of the past.

Limitations: The analysis was only based on a 5 year span, with limited data, findings may not be as accurate as they could be. The "green premium" that is availed to the EV's was difficult to assign a finite number too so findings could be more accurate if we had that.
