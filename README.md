# Project title:
The Homeless: Austin vs. San Francisco

Team Members: Julian Pecino Elijah Montgomery Jason Casperson

Project Description/Outline: This project aims to explore the affordability comparisons between an being homeless in Austin or San Francicso based on the Median income of the U.S. Research Questions to Answer: Is being homeless in Austin or San Francisco better or worse.


Datasets to be Used: 
US Bureau Api
San Francisco's inflation file by month for Tuition, Medical Care, Housing, Fuel, Transportation, shelter, etc for 2010 to 2023.(500 rows per city).
Weekly Income by state or city.
interest rates data
Median Listing Price Austin-Round Rock
Median Income for all cities

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Julian: Presentation Slide,Script, Cleaning 
Elijah: Plotting, Data Collection, visualization
Jason: ETL

Everyone: Presentation

Target audience: Anyone interested in the reaction and response to homelessness.
Local residents that are affected by rising prices and median income in both Austin and San Francisco

Research question: what is the Cost of living between Austin and San Francisco and the comparison of homelessness and, building policies.

Results: Median Income(SF): $123,859
Results: Median Income(ATX): $75,413

Results: House to Income Ratio(SF): 12.3
Results: House to Income Ratio(ATX): 8.0

According to the building policies and the services available, San Francisco has a much more established method and procedure when it come to being homeless vs the policies that are implemented by Austin. These are more towards the line of not being favorable to the homeless individual(s) with architecture that is meant to be a deterrant for them.

The Texas Legislature has dedicated $25 million to address homelessness, mental illness and substance abuse. But many cities have also adopted their own strategies, including camping bans, large shelters and citywide databases to track people experiencing homelessness.

The San Francisco Legislation on it's own allocated 1.1 billion dollars to the Homeless effort in the fiscal year of 2021 to 2022.

Results: San Francisco has way more funding to be able to withstand the cases of homelessness.

Homeless Density Variations are more prevalent and correlate with population density.

We found that it would be based off of what the situation is for the individual and their circumstance. For someone that is going to be trying to be processed through the system and then into a home or abode, San Francisco would have the better opportunity. If the person in question is only trying to get by with out government assistance, they may fare better in Austin.

What is the Cost comparison over a 5-year span for Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Corolla? (Dataset 5 years) -Model 3 Total Cost of Ownership: 47841, per month: 797.35
-Toyota Corolla Total Cost of Ownership: 32770, per month: 546.17 -The Toyota Corolla is cheaper by $251.18

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the Median income household can affford an EV without breaking the bank. That an EV would be useful as a transport medium if there is an established charging route but an ICE vehicle would be best if there is no route established for charging. That over a 5 year span, the Toyota Corolla is $251.18 a month cheaper than the Tesla Model 3.

There is a correlation of EVs and charging stations with population density and location.

Limitations: The analysis was only based on a 5 year span, with limited data, findings may not be as accurate as they could be. The "green premium" that is availed to the EV's was difficult to assign a finite number too so findings could be more accurate if we had that.
